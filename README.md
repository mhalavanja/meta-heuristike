# Meta-heuristics

This project was part of college elective class about tackling some real world problem using meta-heuristic approach.
We used two methods for a project. First one is simple, it is Hill Climbing algorithm and that is implemented in hc.py file. Second one is more complex, it is Genetic algorithm and it is implemented in ga.py. We also used popular python libraries such as numpy and numba to significantly speed up our runtime.
